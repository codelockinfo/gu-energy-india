Here at GU, we are motivated by a desire to help athletes get the most out of their bodies over months and years of training. After all, innovation, athleticism, and longevity are three of our core values.<\/p>\n<p>Inside the Performance Lab, we test our athletesâ€™ metabolism and blood biochemistry, monitor training status and fatigue, track sleep and diet, even measure cognitive performance. While the equipment that makes up our lab has a physical home in our headquarters in Berkeley, we like to think that our lab exists anywhere in the world where our athletes are out there pushing their limits.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>",
