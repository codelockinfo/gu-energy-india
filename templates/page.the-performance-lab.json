After all, innovation, athleticism, and longevity are three of our core values.<\/p><br>\n<p>Inside the Performance Lab, we test our athletesâ€™ metabolism and blood biochemistry, monitor training status and fatigue, track sleep and diet, even measure cognitive performance. While the equipment that makes up our lab has a physical home in our headquarters in Berkeley, we like to think that our lab exists anywhere in the world where our athletes are out there pushing their limits.<\/p><br>\n<p>Whether on a track or trail, on the field or on a mountain, we go wherever the research takes us to get our questions answered.<\/p>",
