This will help tailor energy intake to your needs and provide the beneficial ingredients found in both the gel and drink. While many ingredients are similar in the two products (carbohydrates, branched chain amino acids, and caffeine) each has unique ingredients which may also help improve performance (gel – vitamin E as an antioxidant; drink – taurine to help heart and muscle function, beta-alanine to help increase muscle buffering capacity). Therefore, using both products will help provide every nutritional advantage possible to athletes who demand the best from themselves and their nutrition. For many athletes, all they may need during prolonged exercise is one 21oz bottle of ROCTANE drink and 1 ROCTANE Energy Gel per hour for extra nutritional support to maximize performance.<\/p>"

Beta-alanine is one of the limiting components of an abundant muscle protein called carnosine that help buffer changes in muscle pH during exercise. It has been shown that supplementing beta-alanine can help increase muscle carnosine content, and therefore increase muscle buffering capacity and the ability to minimize changes in muscle pH during intense efforts over lactate threshold.<\/p><p>Caffeine has been shown in many studies to increase exercise performance.

Similarly, prolonged exercise also promotes skeletal muscle fatigue. Taurine helps to maintain heart and muscle function by helping with calcium handling and may help decrease fatigue in these tissues during prolonged exercise.

Several studies have shown that caffeine ingestion during exercise does not influence weight loss, sweat rates, urine output and plasma volume compared to water alone. This may be due to decreased kidney blood flow during exercise, which is proportional to exercise intensity, which minimizes urine production. Therefore, it appears that caffeine will not lead to diuresis if consumed during exercise – and will not contribute to dehydration.<\/p>"
