Depending on your training load and environment, triathletes should drink 2-4 liters of water over a 24-hour period.<\/p><p><\/p><p>FUEL: Carbs are a triathlete’s best friend. It’s always a good idea to top off your energy stores before a swim, ride, or run with a source of easily digestible carbohydrates. Avoid fiber and protein close to a workout – they are harder to digest – and stick to the simple stuff like an Energy Stroopwafel 30 minutes before or an Energy Gel five minutes before your training session.<\/p>",

We like to say anytime is a good time for BCAAs (aka branched-chain amino acids), which are the building blocks of proteins and are found in your diet and in many GU products.

Also, training for a marathon or other race can disrupt your gut, which has a big influence on your immune system. ROCTANE Magnesium Plus Capsules and ROCTANE Probiotic Plus Capsules can make sure your body has enough of these key nutrients so you can recover faster and stay healthy while training hard.<\/p>",
