If you tried to eat more, the body would divert blood from your muscles back to the gut to handle the excess food\/calories. If your metabolism is slower, then one Energy Gel every 45 minutes works just fine. If you have a faster metabolism, try ingesting one Energy Gel every 30 minutes and see if it agrees with your digestion system.

            "answer": "<p>ROCTANE contains more sodium than the original GU Energy Gel and sodium is the main electrolyte lost in sweat. Supplementation with sodium can help prevent cramping as well as minimize the chances of hyponatremia.<\/p><p>The additional amino acids in ROCTANE Energy Gel serve several important functions, including acting as a fuel source for working muscle, and helping promote muscle recovery following exercise. ROCTANE Energy Gel contains branched-chain amino acids that have been shown to help prevent central fatigue by competing with tryptophan for transport across the blood brain barrier. They also contain the amino acids taurine (to help maintain heart contractility and improve cardiac output during long exercise sessions) and beta-alanine (to help promote formation of the intramuscular buffer carnosine).<\/p>"

Your gut adapts to digest and transport dietary carbohydrate if “trained” to do so by eating carbohydrate during your training sessions. So, rule of thumb, whatever you’re using during training, plan to race with the same thing to help optimize your personal performance on race day.<\/p>"
