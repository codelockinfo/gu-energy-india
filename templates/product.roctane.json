If your metabolism is slower, then one Energy Gel every 45 minutes works just fine.

            "answer": "<p>If you already use ROCTANE Energy Gels, you can substitute two-and-a-half ROCTANE Energy Gels for one serving of ROCTANE Energy Drink Mix. Remember, the body can typically handle around 120-240 calories per hour, so keep this in mind when combining the two. This will help tailor energy intake to your needs and provide the beneficial ingredients found in both the gel and drink. While many ingredients are similar in the two products (carbohydrates, BCAAs, and caffeine) each has unique ingredients which may also help improve performance. Therefore, using both products will help provide every nutritional advantage possible to athletes who demand the best from themselves and their nutrition.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>You find 100 calories of carbohydrates in both ROCTANE Energy Gel and GU Energy Gel because there’s no reason to add more. The gut can only absorb so many calories at a time during exercise, especially when most of your blood is being delivered to your hard-working muscles. If you add too many calories during intense exercise, your body can’t send enough blood to your gut to digest the carbs, making your gut cramp, forcing you to slow down.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>ROCTANE contains more sodium than the original GU Energy Gel and sodium is the main electrolyte lost in sweat. Supplementation with sodium can help prevent cramping as well as minimize the chances of hyponatremia.<\/p><p>The additional amino acids in ROCTANE Energy Gel serve several important functions, including acting as a fuel source for working muscle, and helping promote muscle recovery following exercise. ROCTANE Energy Gel contains branched-chain amino acids that have been shown to help prevent central fatigue by competing with tryptophan for transport across the blood brain barrier. They also contain the amino acids taurine (to help maintain heart contractility and improve cardiac output during long exercise sessions) and beta-alanine (to help promote formation of the intramuscular buffer carnosine).<\/p>"

Your gut adapts to digest and transport dietary carbohydrate if “trained” to do so by eating carbohydrate during your training sessions. So, rule of thumb, whatever you’re using during training, plan to race with the same thing to help optimize your personal performance on race day.<\/p>"
