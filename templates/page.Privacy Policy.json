This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how personal information is collected from users of the GU website at <a href=\"https:\/\/guenergy.com\/\">guenergy.com<\/a>(the “Site”), and how that information is used and disclosed. By using our Site, you consent to the terms of this Policy. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time and will notify you of such changes by posting the modified Policy on our Site and indicating at the top of the Policy the date it was last updated.

Personal information is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card (or other account number) when directly linked to him or her, such as information about his or her purchases. Personal information also includes demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies an individual. Aggregate Information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data collected about a group or category of products, services or customers from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products you purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing products and services (including the Site) to customer desires.<\/p><p>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT<\/p><p>You provide personal information to us in a number of ways when you visit the Site.

You understand that when you submit comments, stories, photos, and videos for participation in any survey, contest, sweepstakes, or promotion offered on the Site, that GU may post or publish this information on the Site.
