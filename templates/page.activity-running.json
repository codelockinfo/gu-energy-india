Depending on your training load and environment, runners should drink between two to four liters of water over a 24-hour period.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Carbs are a runner’s best friend. It’s always a good idea to top off your energy stores before a run with a source of easily digestible carbohydrates. Avoid fiber and protein close to a run – they are harder to digest – and stick to the simple stuff like an Energy Stroopwafel 30- minutes before or an Energy Gel five-minutes before you get rolling.<\/p>",
