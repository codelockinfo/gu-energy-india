It’s always a good idea to top off your energy stores before a run with a source of easily digestible carbohydrates. Avoid fiber and protein close to a run – they are harder to digest – and stick to the simple stuff like an Energy Stroopwafel 30- minutes before or an Energy Gel five-minutes before you get rolling.<\/p>",

If you’re going for longer than an hour, 16-30 oz of water per hour with electrolytes will keep you feeling good. Also, fluids help your stomach process the food and carbs you’re eating.<\/p>",
